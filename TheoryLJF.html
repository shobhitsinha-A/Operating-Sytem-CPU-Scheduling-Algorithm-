  <p>Longest Job First</p>

  <p4 style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bolder;">In LJF Scheduling,</p4><br>
   <br>
  <p4>•	Out of all the available processes, CPU is assigned to the process having Largest burst time.</p4><br>

  <p4>•	In case of a tie, it is broken by FCFS Scheduling.</p4><br>

  <p4>•	LJF Scheduling can be used in both preemptive and non-preemptive mode.</p4><br>

  <p4>•	Preemptive mode of Longest Job First is called as Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF).</p4><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p4 style="font-size: 2em;">LJF is a full form of (Longest job first) is a scheduling algorithm in which the process with the longest execution time should be selected for execution next. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution.</p4><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p4 style="font-size: 2em;">Characteristics of LJF Scheduling:</p4><br>  
  <br>
  <br>
  <p4>•	It offers non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</p4><br>

  <p4>•	In this method, when the CPU is available, the next process or job with the longest completion time will be executed first.</p4><br>
  
  <p4>•	It is Implemented with non-preemptive policy.</p4><br>
 
  <p4>•	This algorithm method is useful for batch-type processing, where waiting for jobs to complete is not critical.</p4><br>

  <p4>•	It improves job output by offering longer jobs, which should be executed first, which mostly have a longer turnaround time.</p4><br>

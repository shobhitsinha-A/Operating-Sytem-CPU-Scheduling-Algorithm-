# Operating-Sytem-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-
This project is about implementation of CPU scheduling Algorithm. Various algorithms have been implemented and there visualization are also implemented. 

There are mainly six types of process scheduling algorithms
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling
Shortest Remaining Time
Priority Scheduling
Round Robin Scheduling
